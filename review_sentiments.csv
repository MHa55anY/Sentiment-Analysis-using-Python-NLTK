Nothing to say about the kebab it was mostly the same but coming to the biryani the flavour was not at all same which they used to serve us. On top of that the mutton pieces were not so boiled properly it seems very hard to chew. As well as on all 3 biryani the mutton pieces came with a big bone..If it happened with 1 then its acceptable but this happened with all 3 biryani which is not expected.

The chicken was just perfectly cooked and it wasn't too minced. And that made a difference. It was a nice dish to have with some hot rotis and not that spicy at all. Chicken Tikka Masala- The Reshmi Tikkas were were not dry and were perfectly cooked, they went well with the masalas added to it.

Some have been lost to the time and tides, but a few remain as vigilant as ever. The decor is simple but nice with comfortable seats and big tables. The light is not overpowering and the space is quite big. In the soup section their manchow and special soup stood out for me. For starters I would definitely suggest their prawn section like golden fried or pepper and salt. Their rice items are to die for, as are the chicken items like cashew nut chicken and hunan chicken. The bar section has a limited set of common cocktails, but they make up for it with enough options in whisky. If you are interested in checking out their Indian flavours, do try the tandoor section. It is pretty decent although I wouldn't dare say the best in the area. Their chelo kebab has always been a speciality for me and I have always rated it above other joints.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.495, 'pos': 0.413, 'compound': 0.9588}",Positive

The Lucknow Dum Biryani is my favourite out of them and it is so flavourful that it tantalises your taste buds way too much. The Chicken Kebab Biryani is my second favourite out their, but it is a bit on the spicier side. The Shahi Murg Biryani is an unique take on Biryani and I must admit it's a good take on the Biryani. It's the simple Biryani but with a twist and the twist being the Shahi Murg gravy which is topped upon the biryani handi. The Kolkata Biryani is good too and is a must try. I have also tried their Masala Coke, which had plentiful of chat masala and it is quite refreshing on a hot, humid summer day. The raitas they serve with the Biryanis are however average.

For starters and main course, you have the choice of Vegetarian or non-Vegetarian. Out of all the Starter dishes, the Sawa Futiya Seekh was my favourite! Served with some Pudina Chutney, Chilli Chutney and Salad, this 1.25 ft. long mutton kebab was more than just a scrumptious appetizer. My second favourite was the Kambal Fish Tikka. It was fish wrapped in naan and cooked in tandoor, topped with malai, ahaha! So yumm!!! Loved it so much! And my third favourite was the Tangdi""OyeHoye"". Now the best aprt about this dish was that it was so delicate that you can easily dig into it using a fork and knife or even with your hands. And taste wise, it was creamy, soft, savoury and overall, very appetizing. The Nachos was fun, very crispy. Coming to the main course, the Panner was soft and it wasn't crumbly, but more like it'd melt in your mouth. The Gravy was smooth, creamy and perfectly spiced. The Keema Kaleji was my favorite. I loved the keema, it was so made to perfection. The Dum Aloo, a vegetarian dish, was simply made with Aloo and regular Indian spices. I really liked the Aloo Matar Pulao. If you wanna have some good rice dish but not much fancy types, you can go for this one. It's simple, it's yummy, tastes good and makes your tummy happy too. The Chicken Bharta was my another favorite. The chicken has been finely shredded and mixed with the Bharta. The onion gives a hint of sweetness, along with the simple spices of the Bharta, really makes it such an amazing dish to have with roti or naan. The Sev Tamatar ki Sabji, made with tomatoes, desi masalas and heaps of besan sev, was the last of the curries that I had. And to have it all with, there are Roti Tokris which consists of Naan, Roti and Paranthas. After all this, if you still have space left in your tummy, you can order something from the Dessert menu.

The drinks were pretty good so was the pizza, but the option size was very small, not complaining, just noticed it. The next course was biryani-chiken Tikka and panner biryanis, butter chicken and naans along with one serving of American chopsuey. This is where things went wrong, the biryani did not taste like biryani, but it was okay for pulao, The butter chicken was too sweet, the naan was fine and the chopsuey had pineapple,apple and beetroot in it.
